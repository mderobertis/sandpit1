mdrbot
********
Experimental web app with a dummy login and form to fill in details for a bot.
Runs on node js (nodemon server.js), hit url http://localhost:5000/, login (michael/passw0rd), enter values, and run the bot
Credit goes to https://github.com/jklepatch/eattheblocks where I got the original js code (and mashed it with my own html+js webapp).

This just a muck about POC (for my learning purposes).
